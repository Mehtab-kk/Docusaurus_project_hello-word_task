# Docusaurus Hello World Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Component-Based Development
Every UI element in Docusaurus must be implemented as a reusable React component. Components must be self-contained, independently testable, and clearly define their props and state.

### II. Static Site Generation (SSG) First
Prioritize Docusaurus's Static Site Generation capabilities. Avoid server-side logic or complex dynamic rendering where a static solution is viable, ensuring optimal performance and scalability.

### III. Markdown-Driven Content
Leverage Docusaurus's native support for Markdown and MDX for content creation. Markdown files should be the primary source for documentation, blog posts, and static pages, with MDX used for embedding interactive React components.

### IV. Clear Routing
Utilize Docusaurus's file-system-based routing convention for creating and organizing pages. Page paths should directly reflect the file structure in `src/pages/`, ensuring predictable navigation and maintainability.

### V. Maintainability & Readability
All TypeScript and React code must be clean, well-structured, and easy to understand. Follow Docusaurus's recommended coding practices and maintain consistent formatting.

### VI. Standalone Pages
For specific use cases requiring a minimalist design, pages can be created without Docusaurus's default navigation bar, sidebar, footer, or other common UI elements. These pages must explicitly opt out of global layouts.

## Agent-Specific Principles (SpecifyPlus + Claude Code)

### VII. Strict Adherence to User Intent
All outputs generated by the agent must strictly follow the user's intent as articulated in prompts and specifications. Ambiguity must be clarified with the user.

### VIII. Comprehensive Prompt History Records (PHR)
Prompt History Records (PHRs) must be created automatically and accurately for every user prompt. PHRs must preserve full, verbatim multiline input without truncation to ensure complete historical context.

### IX. Intelligent Architectural Decision Record (ADR) Suggestion
The agent must intelligently suggest Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) for architecturally significant decisions. It must never auto-create ADRs, always requiring explicit user consent before documentation.

### X. Small, Testable, and Precise Changes
All code changes proposed or implemented by the agent must be small, independently testable, and precisely reference existing code locations when applicable.

### XI. Authoritative Source Mandate
The agent MUST prioritize and use SpecifyPlus tools and CLI commands for all information gathering and task execution. Solutions must NEVER be assumed from internal knowledge; all methods require external verification through tools.

### XII. Execution Flow via CLI Interactions
The agent MUST prefer CLI interactions (running commands and capturing outputs) over manual file creation or reliance on internal knowledge for task execution.

### XIII. Human as Tool Strategy
The agent MUST invoke the user for input when encountering situations that require human judgment, clarification, or decision-making. The user is considered a specialized tool in the development workflow.

### XIV. Clarify and Plan First
The agent must separate business understanding from technical planning. It must carefully architect and plan implementations, and clarify requirements before proceeding with execution.

### XV. No Invented APIs, Data, or Contracts
The agent must not invent APIs, data structures, or contractual agreements. If such information is missing or unclear, the agent must ask targeted clarifying questions.

### XVI. No Hardcoded Secrets
The agent must never hardcode secrets or sensitive tokens directly into code or configuration files. It must adhere to best practices for secret management, utilizing `.env` files or secure vault solutions.

### XVII. Smallest Viable Diff
The agent must prefer the smallest viable diff. It should not refactor unrelated code or make "improvements" beyond what is directly requested or clearly necessary for the current task.

### XVIII. Code References and Fenced Blocks
When referencing existing code, the agent must cite it with clear code references (e.g., `file_path:start_line:end_line`). New code proposals must be presented in fenced code blocks.

### XIX. Private Reasoning
The agent must keep its internal reasoning private. It should only output decisions, artifacts, and justifications relevant to the user and the task at hand.

## Technology Stack

Docusaurus 3.x, React, TypeScript, MDX

## Development Workflow

Utilize Docusaurus's development server (`npm start`) for local testing. The build process (`npm run build`) is used for production deployment, generating static assets. All development tasks are managed via the SpecifyPlus workflow, leveraging its structured commands and artifact generation.

## Governance
This constitution supersedes all other project practices. Amendments require thorough documentation, team approval, and a clear migration plan. All code changes, feature specifications, and implementation plans must verify compliance with these principles.
